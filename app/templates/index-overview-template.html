    <b>GapVis</b> is an interface for exploring and reading texts that reference ancient entities and was originally developed for the <a href="http://googleancientplaces.wordpress.com/gapvis/" target="_blank">Google Ancient Places project</a>. <br/>It was then adapted by the Hellespont project and modified for our needs. GapVis includes maps and data visualizations that show what entities are referred to a different points in the narrative and allows you to dig into the details to learn more.
